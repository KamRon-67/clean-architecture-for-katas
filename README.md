# clean-architecture-for-katas

Welcome to the Clean Architecture for Katas repository! This project is a quick set up to build software applications using the principles of Clean Architecture, specifically designed for practice with coding katas.

Clean Architecture emphasizes separation of concerns, testability, and scalability, making it an excellent choice for learning and improving software design skills.

📚 About
This repository serves as a sandbox for developers to:

Practice coding katas with a clean architectural approach.
Explore the separation of concerns in software design.
Build a foundation for writing maintainable and scalable code.
The project leverages layered architecture principles, ensuring:

Entities are independent of frameworks and technologies.
Use Cases encapsulate the business logic.
Interface Adapters facilitate communication between layers.
Frameworks and Drivers (like databases, web servers) stay on the outermost layer.
